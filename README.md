## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Download/clone the repository** and open it in VS Code
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NaveedBuhari/Book-Review-Platform.git

2. **Navigate to the root project folder and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install

   # In a new terminal
   cd client
   npm install

3. **Run server**

   ```bash
   cd server
   node app.js

You should see: MongoDB connected and Server running on port 5000

4. **Run client:**
   Open a new terminal:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start

**NOTE**
- The node_modules folder is excluded from Git using .gitignore
- Be sure to run npm install separately inside both client/ and server/ before running the app.
- This project uses a local MongoDB instance running on port 27017. Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally before starting the server. Alternatively, you may update the connection string in server/app.js to use a remote MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas if preferred.


## 📦 Sample Data Structures (MongoDB)
You can manually insert data in MongoDB using the following formats:

1. 🧑 Users Collection
   ```bash
   {
   "_id": "ObjectId('...')",
   "username": "naveed",
   "password": "123",
   "name": "Naveed Buhari",
   "avatar": "https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=10",
   "bio": "I manage the platform.",
   "role": "admin"
   }

2. 📚 Books Collection
   ```bash
   {
   "_id": "ObjectId('...')",
   "title": "The Alchemist",
   "author": "Paulo Coelho",
   "description": "A journey of a shepherd boy to realize his destiny.",
   "coverImage": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aFt4+OTOL.jpg",
   "rating": 4.5
   }

3. 📝 Reviews Collection
   ```bash
   {
   "_id": "ObjectId('...')",
   "bookId": "BOOK_OBJECT_ID_HERE",
   "userName": "Naveed Buhari",
   "comment": "hiiiii",
   "rating": 5,
   "createdAt": "2025-06-19T11:17:54.210Z"
   }

**NOTE**
- The _id field is automatically generated by MongoDB. It's shown here for reference.
- ⚠️ Replace "BOOK_OBJECT_ID_HERE" with the actual ObjectId of the book you want the review to be associated with.
