## 📦 Sample Data Structures (MongoDB)
**You can create users, add books, and post reviews directly through the platform's user interface once the project is running.**

However, if you'd like to manually insert data into MongoDB (for testing or initialization), refer to the following sample formats:


1. 🧑 Users Collection
   ```bash
   {
   "_id": "ObjectId('...')",
   "username": "naveed",
   "password": "123",
   "name": "Naveed Buhari",
   "avatar": "https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=10",
   "bio": "I manage the platform.",
   "role": "admin"
   }

2. 📚 Books Collection
   ```bash
   {
   "_id": "ObjectId('...')",
   "title": "The Alchemist",
   "author": "Paulo Coelho",
   "description": "A journey of a shepherd boy to realize his destiny.",
   "coverImage": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aFt4+OTOL.jpg",
   "rating": 4.5
   }

3. 📝 Reviews Collection
   ```bash
   {
   "_id": "ObjectId('...')",
   "bookId": "BOOK_OBJECT_ID_HERE",
   "userName": "Naveed Buhari",
   "comment": "hiiiii",
   "rating": 5,
   "createdAt": "2025-06-19T11:17:54.210Z"
   }

**⚠️NOTE**
- The _id field is automatically generated by MongoDB. It's shown here for reference.
- Replace "BOOK_OBJECT_ID_HERE" in the Reviews Collection with the actual ObjectId of the book you want the review to be associated with.
